### STAT 327 001 002 003
This is the files and some HW when I take the courses STAT327, this course is aimed for students to learn R, I think it's very useful to me. 
Although I have learned R for one year and half (before this course I think I was kind of a master on it), I still learnt a lot on this course.
I'll upload some files sequentially once I have the time.

The first file is my last HW in STAT 327 003, it's about image smoothing and edge detecting, which I think is kind of interesting. SInce the processing of image is timing consuming, I use 3 cores of CPU to run it(which is also taught in 327_003).
